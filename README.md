# CS455
Course: Mobile Sensor Networks

This course was taken during the spring of my Junior year (Spring 2018).

Using Matlab, Professor Hung La guided students how to build a network of virtual sensor nodes that could effectively communicate their individual positions and velocities to flock together and form an alpha lattice, an optimal formation in which each node's distances from its respecitve neighbors are equal. The nodes could then flock to a static or dynamic target while maintaining this formation. My code effectively demonstrates these scenarios with n nodes (my code currently sets n to 100).

Next, I will be able to take measurements with the nodes. This will allow them to perform multiple functions. For example, a hypothetical situation would be drones searching through the area of a forest fire for survivors. Another would be drones flocking over the ocean searching for an oil spill. The drones would be able flock while taking measurements and applying weights to those measurements to detect where the greatest degree of the object being searched for lies.

I plan to upload videos of my algorithms in action to a portfolio.

This repository contains 100% my code.
